# Rea-Time_Weather_Monitoring_and_Forecasting
<b>📌 Project Overview:</b><br>
This project focuses on building an interactive and dynamic Power BI dashboard for real-time weather monitoring and short-term forecasting using live or regularly updated weather data APIs (such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or NOAA). The goal is to visualize key weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and precipitation, and to forecast upcoming weather trends using time-series analysis and Power BI's forecasting capabilities.<br>
<b>🎯 Objectives:</b><br>
   Integrate real-time weather data using Power BI web connectors or API calls.<br>
   Monitor and visualize current weather conditions for selected cities or regions.<br>
   Implement short-term forecasting (e.g., next 7 days) using historical data patterns.<br>
Enable drill-downs by city, region, or weather parameter.<br>
Identify anomalies or extreme weather conditions.<br>

<b>📊 Key Features of the Dashboard:</b><br>
🌍 Live Map View of weather conditions by city or region.<br>
📈 Forecast Graphs (e.g., temperature trend for the next 7 days).<br>
🌡️ KPI Cards for current temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.<br>
🔄 Auto-refresh Setup for near real-time updates.<br>
📅 Date and Time Filters to explore historical and future data.<br>
🧠 Optional: Integration of Power BI’s built-in forecasting (exponential smoothing) to predict temperature/humidity levels.<br>

<b>🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:</b><br>
Power BI Desktop / Power BI Service<br>
Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack)<br>
Power Query & DAX<br>
Time Series Forecasting in Power BI<br>
Custom Visuals for Maps & Charts<br>

<b>🧩 Use Cases:</b><br>
Urban weather monitoring for smart cities.<br>
Agriculture planning and irrigation forecasting.<br>
Travel and tourism weather alert system.<br>
Energy demand estimation based on temperature fluctuations.
