# Rea-Time_Weather_Monitoring_and_Forecasting
<b>ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:</b><br>
This project focuses on building an interactive and dynamic Power BI dashboard for real-time weather monitoring and short-term forecasting using live or regularly updated weather data APIs (such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or NOAA). The goal is to visualize key weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and precipitation, and to forecast upcoming weather trends using time-series analysis and Power BI's forecasting capabilities.<br>
